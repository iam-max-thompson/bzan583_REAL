This code is used to build out a softball lineup for a project I am working on this semster.

The goal is to build a lineup with 9 players and multiple different stats for each player in the lineup.

Game_level contains information about the matchup, such as opponent or season.

Player_level represents a single player in a single game as a single row. This is where the stats come from.

For each game in game_level, i need to grab the 9 starters from player_level and grab each of their 7 stats from player_level 
to create 63 columns for each game.

This process involves using stats for over 100,000 rows of players for over 8,500 games.
