Result 4: Two or three sentences that explain your changes and why things got faster.

I think the biggest change that was implemented was a single change in a which() call.

Here it is:
    player_row <- which(player_level$game_id == current_game_id &
                          player_level$batting_position == pos &
                          player_level$team == current_team)

This single which statement is relatively complicated as it has to find three seperate criteria.

The goal is to grab the SINGLE player for the SINGLE game to extract their stats.

However, I did not need to loop through each player in order to re-grab the game_id or the current_team.

Since 9 players all have the same game_id/team, there is no need to do those two filters 9 times instead of just once.

By moving that outside and making a couple other basic changes, I was able to reduce the runtime.

This dropped the self time of which() from over 100 seconds to just 9 seconds. I can't believe this small of a change was able to make such a drastic impact
